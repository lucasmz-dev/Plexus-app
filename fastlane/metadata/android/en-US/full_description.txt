<b>Remove the fear of app compatibility on de-Googled Android devices.</b>

Google Play Services are essential components on most Android devices. They allow you to access your Google account seamlessly and provide Google-specific features for apps that depend on them.
However, when you flash custom ROMs without Google Play Services or opt for alternatives like microG, certain apps may encounter issues — either not functioning at all or experiencing limitations in specific features.

Plexus provides detailed insights into app compatibility whether you’re using ROMs without Google Play Services (like <i>LineageOS</i>) or ROMs with microG (such as <i>CalyxOS</i>). It helps you identify which apps work, don’t work or have limited features.

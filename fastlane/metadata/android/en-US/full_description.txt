<b>Remove the fear of app compatibility on de-Googled Android devices.</b>

When users move to a de-googled ROM like <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a> or <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>, they are faced with opening their apps hoping they function properly. Plexus aims to beat the guessing game, allowing users to know exactly what apps work when they flash a new ROM.
Plexus supports ROMs with no Google Play Services like <i>LineageOS</i>, as well as ROMs with <a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a> (an open source alternative of Google Play Services) like <i>CalyxOS</i>.
